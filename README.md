# Closest-Parking
An algorithm to maintain and manage a parking lot by providing tickets to closest available parking spots that are available. This system utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm.

This is a terminal run program that uses dictionaries data structure to maintain the parking lot entries (empty slots have no values, taken spots contain the number plate of vehicle parked in that spot).
